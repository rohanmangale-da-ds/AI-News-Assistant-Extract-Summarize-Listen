We will take revenge for this.\"Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera said that derogatory remarks against the prime minister were made by the BJP \"agents\" during the Darbhanga rally.Voter Adhikar Yatra: BJP alleges abuses at Congress rally targeting PM Modi and his mother\"This remark has been made by their (BJP's) own agent.

What was meant to be a showcase of young talent and India's scientific leadership has turned into a flashpoint over academic activism, with nearly 300 scientists petitioning the government to act against colleagues accused of engineering a \"boycott\" of Israel.In a letter sent Thursday to the department of atomic energy (DAE), the signatories alleged faculty from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and allied institutes \"hijacked\" the IOAA platform to push through a resolution suspending Israel's participation. They claimed this amounted to a \"grave misuse\" of an international scientific forum inaugurated by the PM, embarrassing India diplomatically. \"The credibility of Indian science and the reputation of TIFR are at stake,\" the letter warned, calling for accountability measures and clear guidelines to prevent politicisation of future events.Iran Executes 'Israeli Spy' For Snooping On Nuclear Scientist During June War | DetailsYou Can Also Check: Mumbai AQI | Weather in Mumbai | Gold Rate Today in Mumbai | Silver Rate Today in MumbaiA parallel letter from around 300 members of the wider STEM fraternity echoed these concerns, terming the incident \"a dangerous precedent\". It accused the faculty of cloaking political activism in the guise of academic debate and warned that such moves eroded India's image as a neutral host.The signatories sought urgent intervention, arguing relations with Israel are strategically vital for India's science and technology partnerships. \"Unless these elements are nipped in the bud, all exhortations to scientists to participate in nation-building will ring hollow,\" the letter said.The other section, however, appears to frame their intervention differently. In a letter to IOAA president Aniket Sule, scientists who moved the resolution cited Israel's ongoing war in Gaza, the destruction of schools and universities, and restrictions on Palestinian participation in the Olympiad as reasons for seeking Israel's suspension. The proposed resolution allowed Israeli students to participate as individuals but barred the state from official representation until it complied with international law. \"The Olympic spirit requires all member nations to respect human rights,\" it said.Select The Times of India as your preferred source on Google Search.Stay updated with the latest local news from your city on Times of India (TOI).

(AI Image) A recently released survey on school education expenditure in India has highlighted significant differences in the cost of education for rural and urban households. The Comprehensive Modular Survey (CMS) on Education, conducted as part of the 80th round of the National Sample Survey (NSS), covered 52,085 households and 57,742 students across India, examining household expenditure between April and June 2025.The findings reveal that rural students, who are more reliant on government schools, incur far lower education expenses compared to their urban counterparts. Government schools continue to serve as the mainstay of Indiaâs education system, accounting for 55.9% of total student enrolment.Higher enrolment in government schools among rural householdsAccording to the survey, 66% of rural students are enrolled in government schools, compared to 30.1% in urban areas. This trend reflects a greater dependence on publicly funded institutions in rural regions. In contrast, private unaided schools account for 31.9% of overall enrolments across the country.Only 26.7% of students in government schools reported paying course fees. The share is significantly higher in private institutions, where 95.7% of students reported paying course fees. Among urban private unaided schools, the proportion rises further to 98%, while in rural government schools, only 25.3% of students pay any course fees.Expenditure per student: government vs non-government schoolsThe average annual household expenditure per student in government schools stands at Rs 2,863. In non-government schools, this amount increases sharply to Rs 25,002. The largest component of spending across all schools is course fees, which average Rs 7,111 per student nationwide. This is followed by spending on textbooks and stationery at Rs 2,002.Urban households bear a higher financial burden, spending an average of Rs 15,143 on course fees alone, while rural households spend Rs 3,979 for the same.CategoryRuralUrban% Enrolment in government schools66%30.10%Avg. course fee (Rs )3,97915,143% students paying fees in govt schools25.30%Not specifiedAvg. total expenditure in govt schools (Rs )2863Not specifiedAvg. total expenditure in non-govt schools (Rs)Not specified25,002 (national average)Regional differences in annual school expenditureState-wise data shows variations in household spending on school education.

About 27% of students received coaching during the academic year, with higher participation in urban areas (30.7%) than rural areas (25.5%). The expenditure on coaching varies by education level and location. Urban higher secondary students spent Rs 9,950 on coaching, while their rural counterparts spent Rs 4,548.Most families fund education without external aidThe survey also reports that 95% of students rely on household members for funding their education.

        "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and owner of X, recently took to the platform to attack CNN for allegedly ârefusingâ to identify the Minneapolis shooter as transgender. Musk quote-tweeted a user noting that CNNâs report did not mention the shooterâs gender identity and added: âCNN is deeply infected with the woke mind virus.â His remark once again placed him at the centre of Americaâs culture war, ensuring that the aftermath of the Minneapolis tragedy became as much about media narratives as the attack itself.Was the Shooter Trans?Authorities later confirmed that 23-year-old Robin Westman, the gunman responsible for the attack at Annunciation Catholic School, identified as transgender. Whether that fact is relevant to the motive remains uncertain, but its omission in some early reports has fuelled debate. Critics accused newsrooms of ideological bias, while others argued that highlighting the detail risks further marginalising trans people.Minneapolis Shooting: Leavitt Blasts Jen Psakiâs âPrayerâ Comment; Gives Big Probe UpdateMuskâs Long History with Trans IdeologyMuskâs commentary reflects his long-running hostility to what he calls âwoke ideology.â Over the years, he has mocked pronoun use, derided protections for trans people, and pledged to oppose gender-affirming care for minors. His position has often sparked criticism from activists and employees alike, but he has remained defiant, presenting himself as a defender of âcommon senseâ against progressive overreach.Muskâs Son Transitioned: Vivian Jenna WilsonMuskâs stance has also drawn attention because of his personal history. His eldest child, once known as Xavier Musk, transitioned in 2020 and is now legally recognised as Vivian Jenna Wilson. She chose her motherâs surname and sought to sever ties with her father, citing his attitudes towards her identity. In later interviews, Vivian described struggling with Muskâs dismissive views and his distance as a parent, while embracing her own voice as a young trans woman. Their estrangement has become a symbolic subplot in Muskâs wider war against trans ideology.The Shooterâs Identity and PoliticsWestmanâs broader profile paints a picture of confusion and rage rather than clear ideology. His weapons were daubed with hateful slogans: anti-Catholic, anti-India, anti-Israel and anti-Trump messages jumbled together alongside crude internet graffiti. Investigators believe his worldview was less a political doctrine than a chaotic reflection of extremist online spaces.Right-Wing ReactionsMany right-wing and MAGA-aligned voices quickly seized on the shooterâs transgender identity to frame the tragedy through culture-war lenses.House GOP Whip Tom Emmer demanded the repeal of Minnesotaâs \"trans refuge\" law, claiming it encouraged confusion among youth and undermined parental rights. He also called for the FBI to classify the shooting as both a hate crime and an act of domestic terrorism.On the fringes, commentators tied to conspiracy-driven platforms portrayed media coverage of the shooterâs gender identity as a âvictoryâ for independent journalismâthough even some on their side cautioned that such rhetoric was callous so soon after the deaths of children.The response reflected a broader pattern: instead of focusing primarily on gun access or security lapses, much of the right turned the spotlight onto gender ideology. Muskâs own intervention amplified this reaction, making the shooterâs trans identity central to the political fallout.Event SummaryThe reality of the attack itself was grim. On Wednesday morning, Westman approached the Annunciation Catholic School during a back-to-school Mass and opened fire through the stained-glass windows with a rifle, a shotgun and a pistolâall purchased legally. Two children, aged eight and ten, were killed. Seventeen others, including 14 classmates and three elderly parishioners, were wounded. Westman later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police Chief Brian OâHara called the act âabsolutely incomprehensible,â while Mayor Jacob Frey said the children âshould be able to pray and play in peace.â The school year had opened with the theme âA future filled with hope.â Instead, Annunciationâs shattered windows now stand as testimony to another American community devastated by gun violence.Select The Times of India as your preferred source on Google Search"

        "headline": "'Using our dollars for Russian oil': Trump aide takes 'laundromat' jibe at India again",
        "body": "NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trumpâs trade advisor Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India, accusing New Delhi of using American trade dollars to finance Russiaâs war in Ukraine. Justifying Washingtonâs newly imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian imports, Navarro said that Indian refiners, working with âsilent Russian partners,â were making huge profits by refining Russian oil and selling it in international markets while âRussia pockets hard currency to fund its war on Ukraine.âTrump's Trade Advisor Blames PM Modi for Ukraine War, Peter Navarro Targets India Over Russia OilIn a post on X, Navarro said, âIndia uses our dollars to buy discounted Russian crude. This isnât just about Indiaâs unfair tradeâitâs about cutting off the financial lifeline India has extended to Putinâs war machine.âPollWhat should India prioritize in response to US tariffs?Adjust trade strategyMaintain independent policyAccording to Navarro, âBefore Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil made up less than 1% of Indiaâs imports. Today? Over 30% -- more than 1.5 million barrels a day. This surge isnât driven by domestic demandâitâs driven by Indian profiteers and carries an added price of blood and devastation in Ukraine.âAlso read - 'Trump won't budge' : US says Russia-Ukraine conflict is 'Modi's war'âIndiaâs Big Oil lobby has turned the largest democracy in the world into a massive refining hub and oil money laundromat for the Kremlin,â he claimed, adding that India now exports more than 1 million barrels a day in refined petroleum, over half of the Russian crude it imports.Navarro said the Biden administration âlargely looked the other way at this madness,â while President Trump was confronting it directly. âA 50% tariff -- 25% for unfair trade and 25% for national security -- is a direct response. If India, the worldâs largest democracy, wants to be treated like a strategic partner of the US, it needs to act like one. The road to peace in Ukraine runs through New Delhi.âAlso read - Western voices back India against Trump's tariff warExpanding on the criticism, he remarked, âWhile the United States pays to arm Ukraine, India bankrolls Russia even as it slaps some of the worldâs highest tariffs on US goods, which in turn punishes American exporters. We run a $50-billion trade deficit with Indiaâand theyâre using our dollars to buy Russian oil. They make a killing and Ukrainians die.â âIt doesnât stop there. India continues to buy Russian weaponsâwhile demanding that US firms transfer sensitive military tech and build plants in India. Thatâs strategic freeloading,â he added.The remarks follow Donald Trumpâs decision earlier this week to double tariffs on Indian imports, citing both trade imbalances and national security concerns. Navarro told Bloomberg TV that it was âreal easyâ for India to get the penalty removed by halting Russian oil purchases, but accused New Delhi of being âarrogantâ in insisting it was their sovereign right.âIndia, youâre the biggest democracy in the world, okay? Act like one... side with the democracies...(instead) youâre getting in bed with the authoritarians,â he said, reminding India of its long-standing border dispute with China. âThese are not your friends folks, okay? And the Russians. I mean, come on!âNavarro also controversially referred to the Russia-Ukraine conflict as âModiâs war,â insisting Indiaâs purchases were funding Moscowâs aggression. When an anchor corrected him, saying âyou mean Putinâs war,â Navarro doubled down, repeating it was âModiâs war.âWhile Navarro praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as âa great leaderâ and India as âa mature democracy with intelligent people running it,â he maintained that New Delhiâs oil deals with Moscow undermined its claim to be a trusted US partner.His comments have drawn criticism within US policy circles, with some analysts pointing out that Washington has not penalised China or the European Union for continuing to buy Russian energy. Others noted that the US itself imports Russian nuclear fuel and precious metals."

        "body": "Sreesanth and Harbhajan Singh (Video grab) NEW DELHI: The Harbhajan SinghâSreesanth altercation remains one of the darkest and most talked-about chapters in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Nearly 18 years later, the infamous âslap-gateâ episode has once again come into focus after former IPL chairman Lalit Modi claimed to possess unseen footage of the incident, which he recently revealed on Michael Clarkeâs Beyond23 Cricket Podcast.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!The controversy dates back to the inaugural IPL season in 2008, during a clash between Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) and Mumbai Indians in Mohali. After Punjabâs victory, players were walking off the field when Mumbaiâs stand-in skipper Harbhajan Singh shockingly slapped Sreesanth. The fast bowler, who had been his usual fiery self in the match, was later seen crying inconsolably on live television, being comforted by teammates. Though the exact trigger for the altercation was never officially confirmed, reports suggested Sreesanthâs on-field remarks may have provoked Harbhajan.EXCLUSIVE | Harbhajan Singh on Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, India vs Pakistan and moreThe fallout was immediate and severe. Harbhajan was suspended for the remainder of the season and slapped with an 11-match ban. The BCCIâs disciplinary committee found him guilty of misconduct, and his match fees were forfeited. Although Harbhajan later issued an apology and both players eventually reconciled, the incident has remained etched in IPL folklore.Now, Modi has stirred the pot once again by sharing what he claims is an unseen video of the episode. âIt happened. Absolutely. And Iâll tell you what happened,â Modi told Clarke when asked about the altercation. âOne of my security cameras was on because I was walking onto the field, and it caught the moment. As players were exchanging handshakes, Bhajji just looked at Sreesanth, said something, and gave him a backhander. Thatâs what the footage shows.âThe video, which Modi says he has âkept back for 18 years,â allegedly captures the moment television cameras missed. âI havenât put it out for so long. But yes, it happened,â Modi added.WATCH the Harbhajan-Sreesanth slap-gate footage here:While both Harbhajan and Sreesanth have long moved on from their playing days, with both now active in commentary and punditry, the resurfacing of this footage has reignited one of the IPLâs most notorious controversies. Whether the video will finally be released publicly remains to be seen, but the incident once again reminds fans of the fiery early years of the league.(Note: TOI cannot verify the authenticity of the video)Select The Times of India as your preferred source on Google Search.Catch Lovlina Borgohain's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 5.

        "body": "Elon Musk and Sam Altman are fighting again. And this time over chat with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Lawyers for Elon Musk are asking a U.S. judge to prevent OpenAI from obtaining documents from rival tech giant Meta Platforms, reigniting a legal skirmish that pits the billionaire against the artificial intelligence company he co-founded. The request, outlined in a late Tuesday court filing, is the latest development in a high-stakes lawsuit where Elon Musk is accused of attempting to harm OpenAI through a \"sham bid\" for its assets.The dispute stems from a claim by OpenAI that Elon Musk, through his lawyers, had approached Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg earlier this year to enlist him in a $97.4 billion bid for OpenAI's assets. According to OpenAI, Zuckerberg declined the offer.Meta said no to OpenAI's 'chat request'Following that assertion, OpenAI petitioned the court to compel Meta to release communications and documents related to the alleged bid. Meta's legal team pushed back, arguing that OpenAI should seek the information directly from Musk and his AI startup, xAI.In their latest filing, Elon Musk's lawyers contend that OpenAI has already received all relevant bid-related documents from them. They described OpenAI's request as an \"expansive discovery\" that is unnecessary for the current phase of the trial.However, OpenAI's lawyers fired back, asking the judge to reject Musk's claims. They assert that their request is not \"sprawling\" but rather a targeted effort to obtain specific documents spanning a limited period. They also highlighted the need for depositionsâincluding of Musk himselfâif, as plaintiffs claim, key communications were primarily oral.xAI founder Elon Musk's $97 billion bid to buy OpenAIThis legal battle began last year when Elon Musk sued OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, over the company's shift to a for-profit model. OpenAI countersued Musk in April, accusing him of attempting to damage the company.In a key ruling earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers determined that Elon Musk must face OpenAI's claims that his public statements, social media posts, and the alleged bid were part of a concerted effort to undermine the AI startup.A jury trial for the case is scheduled for spring 2026.Select The Times of India as your preferred source on Google Search.AI Masterclass for Students.

        "body": "Chris Wood further observed that India's ongoing Russian oil purchases have become a major point. (AI image) The Donald Trump administrationâs move to impose 50% tariffs on India is âdraconianâ, according to Jefferies' emerging markets strategist Chris Wood, who believes that the step will lead to a direct hit of $55-60 billion.According to an ET report, Christopher Wood, Global Head of Equity Strategy at Jefferies, said in his weekly GREED & Fear newsletter: \"This amounts to an estimated $55-60 billion blow to the economy, with the most negatively impacted sectors being textiles, footwear, jewellery, and gems â all of which are employment-intensive.\"Donald Trump's Tariff Gamble On India Fuels BRICS Rise As US Economist Warns Of A Historic BackfireTariffs on India: Trumpâs âpersonal piqueâ?Chris Wood is of the view that the penal tariffs on India are a result of Trumpâs âpersonal piqueâ at being excluded from mediating in the India-Pakistan tensions following their four-day military confrontation in May. India has maintained its position against external mediation in Pakistan relations.Wood further observed that India's ongoing Russian oil purchases have become a major point, saying: \"The draconian tariffs India now faces are the result of an unfortunate series of events, compounded by the fact that Trump has not ended the Ukraine conflict as he had promised.\"Also Read | No âdead economyâ? India may surpass US as 2nd largest economy in PPP by 2038 - despite Trump tariffsWood highlighted the unfortunate timing, noting that both nations were reportedly approaching a trade agreement before the Pakistan situation escalated, following the tragic incident in Kashmir's Pahalgam in April, where 26 Indian tourists lost their lives.Wood highlighted that agricultural imports would be rejected by any Indian administration, considering their severe effects. \"Nearly 250 million farmers and related labour derive their incomes from agriculture, with the sector accounting for nearly 40% of India's workforce,\" he said according to the ET report.Whilst Trump has imposed tariffs on goods, India's thriving services exports remain untouched, generating $150 billion yearly from IT services. US multinational-established global capability centres in India contribute an additional $60 billion in revenue. \"When Trump talks about trade, he seems almost solely focused on trade in goods,\" Wood noted.The tariff situation exacerbates existing challenges, with nominal GDP expected to decrease to 8% year-on-year this quarter, significantly lower than the usual 10-12%. Jefferies' India branch predicts nominal GDP growth will reduce from 10% in FY25 to 8.5-9% in FY26, marking the lowest figures outside the Covid period in twenty years.The government is actively implementing reforms to address these challenges. Following February's budget announcement of income tax reductions, the Modi government plans to introduce a simplified GST structure, reducing the existing four-tier system (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) to two levels (5% and 18%). Reports indicate these GST modifications might be implemented before end-September.Also Read | âDeal dependent uponâ¦â: India indicates no compromise on red lines for US trade pact; âwe cannot overlook some..âHalf of the companies listed may survive the 50% tariffs, but these duties present a \"potentially massive negative for SMEs\" within sectors that generate substantial employment, says Wood. According to Wood, this situation could negatively impact microfinance and consumer lending institutions, with potential GDP reduction of 1-1.2 percentage points if the tariff situation continues.The ongoing tariff dispute might result in India strengthening ties with China, as is evident by the planned resumption of direct flights between both nations in September following a five-year gap. Chinese imports to India currently stand at an annualised $118 billion, constituting 16% of total imports and showing a 13% yearly increase. \"India needs China's cheap goods, for example, solar panels,\" Wood pointed out.Wood highlighted a significant contradiction: the absence of a clear American foreign policy direction is \"not in the national interest since it is surely not in America's interests to push India closer to China\".

        "body": "Once operating 57 branches nationwide, Hamburgini collapsed after a 2024 food poisoning incident severely damaged its reputation and sales/ Image: X Twelve years after its founding, the Saudi fast-food chain Hamburgini is shutting down operations following a court-ordered liquidation of its parent company, Food Basics Trading. The decision, driven by severe reputational and financial damage from a 2024 food poisoning incident, marks the collapse of one of the Kingdomâs most prominent local restaurant success stories.Liquidation proceedings officially begin On August 27, 2025, a court ruling from the Ninth Circuit of the Riyadh Commercial Court ordered the opening of liquidation procedures for Food Basics Trading Company, the closed joint-stock firm that owns the Hamburgini restaurant chain. The order was issued in Case No. 471003464 for the year 1447 AH, dated 02/11/1447 AH, and announced publicly via the Saudi Ministry of Commerce's \"Esar\" platform. Mubarak bin Eid Al-Anzi, appointed as the bankruptcy trustee, has called on all creditors to submit their claims using the designated Creditor Claim to Debtor form within 90 days from the announcement date. The company, registered under commercial number 1010248348, is now undergoing full legal liquidation as part of Saudi Arabiaâs Bankruptcy Law framework, which governs the process for distressed firms, aiming to safeguard creditor rights and ensure regulated exit or restructuring pathways.From rapid growth to sudden collapse Founded in 2013 in Riyadh, Hamburgini quickly became a standout local brand in the fast-food sector. It grew popular among young Saudis due to affordable pricing, daily-prepared meals, and offerings such as smashed burgers, sweet potato fries, real chicken tenderloin, and lettuce burgers, a novelty in the local market at the time. Hamburgini also emphasized fresh-baked goods and a made-to-order model. By 2020, Hamburginiâs footprint had rapidly expanded across Saudi Arabia. The brand claimed to be the chain with the most branches in the Kingdom, with a presence in:  Riyadh (29 branches)   Jeddah   Eastern Province   Qassim   Hail   Additional urban and regional centers   In total, 57 branches were operational at the time of closure. The brand owed much of its expansion to strong digital marketing, savvy social media campaigns, and ambitious leadership under CEO Nawaf Al-Fawzan. In a 2020 interview, Al-Fawzan had announced plans to list 20% of the company's capital on the Nomu Parallel Market and open 20 more branches, a sign of the companyâs growth trajectory at the time.The companyâs registered capital stood at one million dirhams.The 2024 poisoning incident that sparked the downfall In 2024, Hamburginiâs upward momentum came to a halt following a mass food poisoning outbreak at one of its branches in Riyadh. The incident resulted in more than 70 injuries and one fatality, sparking national attention and concern. Subsequent investigations traced the cause to Clostridium botulinum bacteria found in Bon Temps mayonnaise, an imported ingredient used in Hamburginiâs food preparation. Although the contamination was linked to an external supplier, Hamburgini bore the brunt of the fallout. Authorities from the Ministry of Municipalities and Housing responded by:  Shutting down all Hamburgini branches in Riyadh   Withdrawing the contaminated mayonnaise product from the market   Halting production at the implicated factory   Despite these measures, the chain suffered extensive reputational damage. The public's trust in the brand plummeted, directly impacting sales, revenues, and foot traffic across its branches.Financial consequences and final closure As operational losses mounted, Hamburgini faced rising debts and an increasingly unsustainable financial position. Branch closures followed, and the company struggled to meet its financial obligations. By mid-2025, the signs of financial distress were clear: a prolonged inability to recover consumer trust, stagnating sales, and a shrinking footprint across the Kingdom. With no viable path to recovery, Food Basics Trading Company filed for bankruptcy. The liquidation announcement in August 2025 marked the official end of Hamburginiâs journey, from a pioneering local burger chain to a case study in how a single crisis can unravel years of growth.Select The Times of India as your preferred source on Google Search"

        "headline": "Stunning prediction! 'Shreyas Iyer can captain India to a World Cup win'",
        "body": "Shreyas Iyer (Image credit: AFP) NEW DELHI: Astrologer Greenstone Lobo has made a huge prediction on star India batter Shreyas Iyer, who was ignored by the selectors and left out of the 15-member Asia Cup 2025 squad.Lobo, who describes himself as a âscientific astrologer,â believes Iyerâs horoscope is so strong that not only will he make a comeback soon, but he also has the potential to captain India to a major tournament victory.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!âShreyas Iyer has been ignored once again. Is it going to be curtains for him, or is he going to make a huge comeback? He has got a phenomenal chart. Born in 1994, he has planet Pluto in an exalted position, Neptune in the deepest exaltation, and three asteroids â planet X, planet Z, and Chiron â in very strong positions. His chart is so powerful that he has the capacity to even lead the country in one of the formats,â Lobo said on TimesofIndia.com.The astrologer went as far as predicting that Iyer could guide India to a World Cup triumph if given the leadership. âEven if heâs going to captain, he can lead India to a huge victory in some major tournament, something like even a World Cup. So if he has such a chart, then why is he being ignored? Probably, whatever is happening at this point of time is only for the benefit of Shreyas. We can take this Asia Cup as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming T20 World Cup,â he added.Lobo suggested that Iyerâs comeback is inevitable. âMaybe some of the players who are selected ahead of Shreyas Iyer will not do so well. Itâs very unfortunate for them, but because Shreyas has got a phenomenal chart, he canât be ignored forever. One of the players, or maybe a couple of them, will give way for him. Something not so desirable for India may happen, but Shreyas will force his way into the T20 squad once again, and he will be available when it really matters â the T20 World Cup next year.âLooking further ahead, Lobo claimed Iyer would become a mainstay in the longer formats as well. âHe will make a way for himself in the 50-over format. In 2027, when the World Cup comes up, Shreyasâs planets are extremely powerful. So he is going to be a part of the squad, you never know. Hopefully, he has a bigger role to play, and if he is going to be a part of the squad for the 50-over World Cup, then India definitely has the strongest squad.âThe astrologer also had a message for the national selectors. âI donât know if Gautam Gambhir and Ajit Agarkar are listening or not, but you cannot keep someone like Shreyas Iyer in the shed for long. Many cricketers are voicing their opinion that he deserves a place. Skill-wise, technique-wise, and run-wise, he has everything. Astrologically speaking, he has a phenomenal chart. If heâs not going to be factored in, if heâs not going to be part of the playing XI, India is at a loss.âLobo further warned against overlooking Iyer in favour of Shubman Gillâs captaincy push. âAt this point of time, Shubman Gill is being forced upon us as a captain in every format. If he becomes captain in all the formats, then someone like Shreyas Iyer will be pushed back â which is not good for Indiaâs prospects. If we have to win more World Cups, then we need different captains in different formats. You cannot keep someone like Shreyas Iyer away, and he will not be away for long. Mark my words â Shreyas Iyer will force his way and make an entry into the T20 squad very soon.âSelect The Times of India as your preferred source on Google Search.Catch Lovlina Borgohain's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 5.

        "headline": "From Clarke to Yuvraj: Cricketers who battled cancer with courage",
        "body": "Richie Benaud, Yuvraj Singh, Michael Clarke and Geoffrey Boycott NEW DELHI: Cancer has touched the lives of several cricketers across generations, testing their courage in ways no opponent on the field ever could. The latest reminder of this ongoing battle came from former Australia captain Michael Clarke, who revealed that he has undergone his sixth surgery for skin cancer.The 44-year-old, who led Australia to the 2015 ODI World Cup title, shared a post-operative picture on Instagram, urging fans to take preventive measures seriously. Clarkeâs message was simple but powerful: âSkin cancer is real! Especially in Australia. Another one cut out of my nose today. A friendly reminder to get your skin checked. Prevention is better than cure but in my case, regular check ups and early detection is key.âGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!Here's a list of cricketers who battled cancer:MICHAEL CLARKEClarke was first diagnosed with skin cancer in 2006 during his playing career and has since endured multiple procedures. In 2019, he had three non-melanoma lesions removed, including one from his forehead. Four years later, in 2023, he needed 27 stitches after a basal cell carcinoma was excised from his chest. That experience prompted him to join hands with the Australian Skin Cancer Foundation to spread awareness in a country where sun exposure-related illnesses are widespread.His most recent surgery, this time to remove a lesion from his nose, underscores how the disease requires vigilance and persistence. Clarke has used his platform to remind fans and fellow cricketers that early detection and preventive checks can save lives.RICHIE BENAUDClarkeâs story resonates with the journey of another Australian icon, Richie Benaud. The legendary captain and commentator was diagnosed with skin cancer late in life, with lesions on his forehead and scalp. Just months after disclosing his condition, Benaud passed away on April 10, 2015. His openness about his illness highlighted the risks faced by athletes who spend long hours under the sun.YUVRAJ SINGHPerhaps no cricketing tale of resilience has captured hearts like that of Yuvraj Singh. The 2011 World Cup hero delivered one of the greatest all-round performances in tournament history, scoring 362 runs and taking 15 wickets, all while battling serious health issues. Soon after lifting the trophy, he was diagnosed with a rare germ cell tumour in his lung.Yuvraj underwent aggressive chemotherapy in the USA, enduring months of pain, weakness, and mental stress. But his spirit shone through â he returned to international cricket in 2012, scripting one of sportâs most inspiring comeback stories. His fight against cancer continues to motivate countless people worldwide.GEOFFREY BOYCOTTFormer England opener Geoffrey Boycott, renowned for his grit at the crease, displayed the same resilience when diagnosed with throat cancer in 2003. The news forced him to step away from commentary duties during Indiaâs tour of England. Boycott underwent 35 sessions of radiotherapy and, true to form, staged a remarkable recovery. Within a year, he was back behind the microphone, proving that nothing could silence his voice.ANDY FLOWERIn 2010, while serving as Englandâs head coach, former Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower was diagnosed with skin cancer on his right cheek. Surgery ensured a full recovery, and since then, Flower has become one of the sportâs most prominent advocates for skin cancer awareness. His story serves as a reminder that vigilance and early intervention can make a decisive difference.GRAEME POLLOCKSouth African batting great Graeme Pollock faced colorectal cancer in 2013. Though he overcame the illness physically, it took a heavy financial toll. By 2014, Pollock was on the brink of bankruptcy, struggling to keep up with mortgage payments. With little support from cricketing bodies, he organised a benefit dinner attended by stars like Graeme Smith, Shaun Pollock, and Mike Procter, which provided some relief. His ordeal revealed how health battles can extend well beyond the medical fight.MARTIN CROWENew Zealandâs elegant batsman Martin Crowe announced in 2012 that he had been diagnosed with lymphoma. Though he initially responded well to treatment and even returned to public life, the cancer resurfaced in 2014. Despite a brave fight, Crowe passed away in 2016, aged just 53. His story remains one of cricketâs most poignant reminders of how fragile life can be, even for its greatest warriors.SAM BILLINGSIn 2022, England wicketkeeper-batter Sam Billings underwent two operations to remove a malignant melanoma from his chest. His condition was detected after he attended a skin cancer screening in Kent, highlighting the importance of proactive checks. Since then, Billings has spoken openly about the dangers of skin cancer, urging fans and fellow athletes to be mindful of early signs and preventive care.Select The Times of India as your preferred source on Google Search.Catch Lovlina Borgohain's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 5.

        "body": "Sachin Tendulkar (BCCI Photo) NEW DELHI: Sachin Tendulkar is celebrated as one of the greatest batters in cricket history, but his bowling remains an often-overlooked part of his game. Though never a frontline bowler, Tendulkarâs versatility made him a valuable part-time option. He could bowl medium pace, off-spin, and leg-spin, often stepping in to break stubborn partnerships or give the main bowlers a breather.In Tests, Tendulkar claimed 46 wickets across 200 matches. While his bowling role was limited, he still produced memorable spells, with best figures of 3/10.What Sachin Tendulkar said on not having a century at Lord'sGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW!During a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) session, a fan asked him: âHi Sachin, whatâs the favorite wicket that youâve ever taken (while bowling)?â Tendulkarâs reply was short and telling: âMoin Khanâ¦ last ball of the day.âThe wicket came in the 2004 Multan Test, remembered primarily for Virender Sehwagâs historic 309, which made him the first Indian to score a triple century in Tests and earned him the nickname âMultan ka Sultan.â The game is also etched in memory for Rahul Dravidâs declaration when Tendulkar was unbeaten on 194 â though that is another story.After India piled up 675/5, Pakistanâs resistance rested on Abdul Razzaq and Moin Khan, with the hosts five down. Tendulkar was handed the final over of Day 3.Employing clever tactics, he deliberately pushed fielders back to allow Razzaq a single, ensuring the nervous Moin Khan would face the strike. What followed was pure genius. Tendulkar bowled a deceptive googly that slipped through Moinâs defense and crashed into the stumps.A stunned Moin walked back as India capped the day perfectly. The visitors eventually won the Test by an innings and 52 runs, but for Tendulkar, that single dismissal remains one of his most cherished bowling moments.Select The Times of India as your preferred source on Google Search.Catch Lovlina Borgohain's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 5.

He spent nine days in jail following his arrest in 1986 and a Midnapore court sentenced him to jail for six months and slapped a fine of Rs 1,000. Bera spent half his life fighting the case.You Can Also Check: Kolkata AQI | Weather in Kolkata | Gold Rate Today in Kolkata | Silver Rate Today in KolkataJustice Prasenjit Biswas on Aug 26 upheld Beraâs conviction saying there was enough proof that he had violated provisions of West Bengal Kerosene Control Order, 1968, by storing 219 litres of kerosene and diesel without valid papers. But he was reluctant to send Bera to jail after so many years.He held that in the past 39 years of trial and appeals, Bera had undergone âimmense trauma, mental incarnation and anguishâ.The HC also held that a procedure that deprives a person of his liberty cannot be âreasonable, fair and justâ unless it ensures a speedy trial to determine a personâs guilt.Weighing on whether Bera should undergo the remaining part of his sentence, the HC said, âThere can be no doubt that speedy trial is an integral and essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article 21. It is trite law (well established) that Article 21 and the right to speedy public trial is not merely a twinkling star in the high heavens to be worshipped and paid lip-service to, but is a meaningful protective provision.... An expeditious hearing of appeals against convictions is fairly and squarely within the mandate of the Article.âJustice Biswas said it was well-established in law that âlong delay before courts in taking a final decision with regard to the guilt or otherwise of the accused is one of the mitigating factors for superior courts to take into consideration while taking a decision on the quantum of sentence,â and reduced Beraâs jail term to nine days but increased the fine from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000.Select The Times of India as your preferred source on Google Search.Stay updated with the latest local news from your city on Times of India (TOI).

The film doesn't have any big stars but this mythology film backs strongly on religious sentiments and the stunning use of VFX and visuals along with the dialogues. The film has continued to stand tall amidst the wave of 'Saiyaara' and even stood strong when two big movies like 'War 2' and 'Coolie' released. Mahavatar Narsimha continues its strong run at the box office even in its fifth week. The animated film showed a slight jump on its 5th Wednesday, thanks to Ganesh Chaturthi and collected Rs 2.25 crore. While it's a holiday in many parts of the country due to the festival, it saw a jump. But this is also great because due to Ganesh Chaturthi, many also do not prefer to go out of the house due to crowds on the road, especially in a state like Maharashtra. Collecting Rs 2.25 crore on fifth Wednesday, that too for an animated film, is huge. The total collection of the movie now stands at Rs 237.1 crore, according to Sacnilk. This is the total collection in India in all languages, which includes Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. From a â¹15-cr budget to â¹200-cr triumph: How Mahavatar Narsimha became Indiaâs animated kingThe collection is much higher now than 'Sitaare Zameen Par' and 'Housefull 5' which had made Rs 167.3 crore (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu combined) and Rs 183.3 crore respectively. Even if we just calculate the Hindi collection of 'Mahavtar Narsimha', it is Rs 179 crore and that's still higher than 'Sitaare Zameen Par'. Directed by Ashwin Kumar, the film will now face fresh competition with the release of 'Param Sundari' this weekend.

        "body": "SSC overhauls exam system after glitches, re-exam held for 59,500 candidates. (AI Image) The Staff Selection Commission (SSC) on August 29 conducted a special re-examination for 59,500 candidates affected by technical glitches during the original SSC Selection Post Phase 13 exams. The re-exam was held in three shifts to accommodate all affected aspirants.The earlier exams were held between July 24 and August 2 but faced widespread technical issues that impacted a significant number of candidates. In response, the Commission initiated a detailed analysis of exam logs to identify those who experienced disruptions.Protests led to Commission's decisionFollowing large-scale protests by aspirants and coaching professionals at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, the SSC announced a re-exam for the impacted candidates. Over a thousand individuals gathered at the protest site, demanding fair conduct and resolution of examination issues.Subsequently, the Commission scheduled three special exam shifts on August 29. The exam city intimation slips were released on August 22, followed by the issue of admit cards on August 26.Exam rescheduling and new security measuresThe SSC also postponed the Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Examination 2025, initially scheduled for August 13. The exam will now be held in mid-September to allow technical and administrative adjustments.In a broader move towards securing its examination process, the SSC introduced multiple system changes. These include Aadhaar-based authentication, implementation of a new normalisation method, and tighter monitoring of private exam centres.Change in exam conducting agency and content policyUntil June 2025, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) was responsible for conducting SSC exams. From July 2025, Eduquity Career Technologies assumed the role through an open tender. In compliance with a directive from the Supreme Court, the responsibility for setting question papers has been separated from the exam conducting agency and handed over to independent content providers.IT system upgrades and new partnershipsTo improve examination security and technical performance, SSC has partnered with the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC). CDAC is currently integrating SSCâs systems with those of Eduquity. This transition process has faced some initial challenges.Overview of key SSC exam changesAspectDetailsAffected candidates59,500Reason for re-examTechnical glitches in original exam (July 24 â August 2)Date of re-examAugust 29Number of exam shifts3Previous exam agencyTCS (until June 2025)Current exam agencyEduquity Career Technologies (from July 2025)Question paper responsibilityNow handled by independent content providersNew security measuresAadhaar-based authentication, normalisation, stricter monitoringIT integration partnerCDACDelayed examCGL 2025 (postponed from August 13 to mid-September)The SSC's response includes both immediate re-examination efforts and long-term structural reforms, aiming to ensure fair and secure exam conduct for future recruitment cycles.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

        "headline": "This country has the most lions in the world and its name begins with the letter ‘T’",
        "body": "Think of lions and Africa is the first image that often comes to mind. But do you know which country has the largest number of lions in the wild today in the whole wide world? The answer is Tanzania, a beautiful African country which is now known for being home to the worldâs most iconic big cats. According to official numbers from the IUCN, WWF, national censuses, and UNESCO-listed reserves, Tanzaniaâs lion population is around 14,500. The country is often regarded as the âLion Capital of the Worldâ. Letâs find out more about Tanzania: Tanzania: The Lion Capital of the WorldFor those who donât know, Tanzania is home to about 14,000â15,000 lions. As per reports by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) and other wildlife organizations such as Panthera and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), nearly 40â50% of the global wild population of lions lives in Tanzania alone.Itâs a remarkable feat and an extraordinary number. It was made possible because Tanzania has kept aside more land for wildlife as compared to other countries in Africa. Nearly 38% of Tanzaniaâs land is under protection. It includes some of the globally renowned regions such as:The Serengeti National Park : The park is famous for the Great Wildebeest Migration and offers lions with endless prey opportunities.The Ngorongoro Conservation Area : This is where you can find lions thriving in the fertile volcanic crater. Quite rare! Ruaha National Park: It is among the largest lion habitats in East Africa. As per Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) surveys, there are more than 3,000 lions here alone.Nyerere National Park: This is another critical refuge for tigers and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.What global numbers showAs per data, the reality is sad. The global lion population has dropped from over 200,000 a century ago to fewer than 25,000 today (IUCN Red List). These big cats today come under the Vulnerable category. There are certain regional populations, like those in West Africa, at the brink of extinction.Other countries with lion populations: South Africa: Some 3,000â3,500 lions, which live across Kruger National Park and private reserves (South African National Parks reports).Botswana: About 3,000 lions and many found in the Okavango Delta (Botswana Department of Wildlife & National Parks).Kenya: according to the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) 2021 National Lion Census, there are over 2,500 lions living here.Zambia & Zimbabwe: Both countries host between 1,000â2,000 lions, largely concentrated in Luangwa Valley and Hwange.India: India is noted for being home to the last surviving Asiatic lions. Asiatic lions can only be found in Gujaratâs Gir Forest and surrounding regions. The 2020 Asiatic Lion Census by the Gujarat Forest Department recorded 674 lions, and by 2025, that number has climbed to about 891.So, the next time you plan a wildlife trip, make sure you add Tanzania on your itinerary, the worldâs true lion kingdom!"

        "headline": "Paryushan beyond fasting: The culture of mindful eating",
        "body": "Paryushan, Jainism's key festival, emphasizes reflection, discipline, and spiritual purification through non-violence and mindful living. Celebrated globally, its values resonate beyond the Jain community, promoting compassion and balance. The festival involves plant-based diets, avoiding root vegetables, and fasting. It culminates in seeking forgiveness from all beings, fostering interconnectedness. Paryushan's mindful eating principles offer a timeless message of restraint and kindness. What is Paryushan?Paryushan is one of the most important festivals for the Jain community. It is a period of deep reflection, discipline, and spiritual cleansing. The festival is not only about observing fasts but also about practicing self-restraint, compassion, and forgiveness. At its core, Paryushan is about aligning oneâs lifestyle with principles like non-violence, kindness, discipline, and mindful living. The word âJainâ itself comes from Ja-In, meaning to conquer or have control over oneâs senses. This discipline lies at the heart of both fasting and mindful eating.Who celebrates it?Paryushan is primarily celebrated by Jains across the world, but its values are not limited to the community alone. People outside Jainism also find meaning in the practices associated with the festival, especially its focus on non-violence, mindful eating, and simplicity. These are universal ideas that resonate beyond religion and can be embraced by anyone seeking balance, compassion, and awareness in daily life.What foods are allowed?During Paryushan, meals are prepared with deep consciousness about the harm they may cause to other living beings. Foods that are lighter, plant-based, and non-violent in their preparation are chosen. Green vegetables, lentils, grains, fruits, and pulses become the staples. Eating at fixed times of the day and avoiding indulgence are also emphasized. The goal is not just physical sustenance, but to bring mindfulness and gratitude into every bite. Eating becomes more than nourishment, it becomes an act of spiritual practice.What foods are forbidden?A unique aspect of Paryushan is the avoidance of root vegetables such as potatoes, onions, garlic, and carrots. This is because uprooting them destroys the entire plant and disturbs countless microorganisms in the soil. Food after sunset is also avoided, as it reduces the chances of consuming insects that may be invisible in the dark. These practices may seem strict on the surface, but they are deeply practical, rooted in compassion, and aligned with the idea of minimizing harm.Practices during ParyushanParyushan is not only about food restrictions,it is a holistic discipline that touches every part of life. People engage in fasting, meditation, prayer, reading scriptures, and acts of kindness. The emphasis is on self-control, reflecting on oneâs actions, and asking for forgiveness. The festival ends with Michhami Dukkadam, a practice of seeking forgiveness from every living being for any harm caused knowingly or unknowingly.Divya Fofani, digital content creator, believes, âParyushan for many people (Jain & Non Jain) is about fasting. For many people Jains and Jainism is about not eating onion garlic potatoes and fasting during Paryushan, but it goes way beyond and deeper. Paryushan is based on a lot of principles like non-violence, compassion for every living being big or small, discipline, good deeds and more. Our practices and rituals are based on practicality and Jainism is a way of life rather than a religion. Jain literally translates to Ja-In which means conquering/having control over your senses and fasting is also about that too, about being disciplined, not giving in to your desires and senses and controlling your mind and feeling your soul rather than your mind. Mainly Paryushan is about asking for forgiveness for all the wrong doings you might have done knowingly or unknowingly, cleansing your mind and soul, coming out clean, asking for forgiveness to all the beings, insects, humans & everyone we might have hurt.âWhy mindful eating matters todayWhat makes Paryushan stand out is how relevant its practices feel in todayâs world. Mindful eating, plant-based diets, and sustainability have become popular buzzwords in modern wellness, but these values have been a way of life in Jainism for centuries. Every small choice, whether it is avoiding waste, eating with awareness, or consuming food that minimizes harm has ripple effects on health, society, and the environment. Mindful eating is not just about what is on the plate, but about how we approach food. Eating without distractions, finishing what is served, expressing gratitude before meals, and reflecting on the journey of food from farm to plate are simple ways to bring the spirit of Paryushan into everyday life.A culture of forgiveness and compassionThe ultimate goal of Paryushan goes beyond diet and fasting. It is about cleansing the mind and heart, letting go of grudges, and practicing forgiveness. When one asks for forgiveness from humans, animals, and even the tiniest beings, it creates a sense of interconnectedness. Eating mindfully ties into this same principle, recognizing that our choices affect others, whether visible or invisible. The culture of mindful eating taught during Paryushan is not meant for eight days alone. It is a reminder that restraint, gratitude, and compassion can shape how we live every day. In a world often defined by excess, Paryushan offers a timeless message: to eat less with more awareness, to live lightly, and to carry kindness into every choice we make.All Images Courtesy: istock"

        "headline": "2025 Renault Kiger review: Has Kiger finally cracked the code?",
        "body": "2025 Renault Kiger  The Renault Kiger has always been pitched as a sub-4 meter compact SUV with big ambitions. Not just that, at its price tag the model also cuts several popular hatchbacks in India. The Kigerâs sales may not have lived up to Renaultâs expectations, but that could soon change with the recent update. The car hasnât transformed radically, but it has improved in the areas that matter. We got behind the wheel of the updated Kiger on a curated test track, and here are our first impressions.2025 Renault Kiger: DesignAt first glance, the new Renault Kiger now manages to leave quite an impression. Iâd say the Kiger now looks closer to cars from a segment above, and credit goes to Renaultâs design team for pulling that off.The silhouette hasnât changed much, but the tweaks make it look sharper and more in tune with what young urban buyers like. The front fascia, however, has been revamped completely for good. There are sleek DRLs flanking the new grille which itself looks quite premium and modern. Below that, thereâs a tri-pod LED setup, and the bolder bumper giving it a muscular face. There are also glossy black accents here and there to give it a sophisticated, premium touch. From the side, the chunky cladding, diamond-cut alloys, and floating roof effect complete the sporty crossover look. Rear hasnât changed much save for a few changes such as the updated bumper and clear cluster for the C-shaped LED tail lamps. But it goes well in sync with the update. Overall, the design will be one of the strongest points for the model in my opinion, which wasnât the case before. 2025 Renault Kiger: Cabin experienceFrom the inside, the cabin feels familiar but more premium than before. The dashboard layout is neat, and Renault has tried to maximise space: which shows in the good amount of headroom and decent legroom for both rows. The seats are well-cushioned, though a bit more under-thigh support at the rear would have been welcome on longer drives. For reference, Iâm 5â10 and was comfortably seated in the rear. Another thing that impressed us was the neat, dual-tone upholstery that looks quite premium especially with the contrasting neon stitching.Feature-wise, you get an 8-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a 7-inch digital driver display, automatic climate control, push-button start, wireless charging, and an Arkamys 3D sound system with 6 speakers. Renault has also added small but useful touches to better storage options. Safety kit includes six airbags, ABS with EBD, traction control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system.If there is one area that could have been better it is the materials used, especially around the central console, along with the quality of the infotainment screen. The system is easy to use and well laid out, but the display itself lacks crispness and could use an upgrade. That said, it is not really a deal breaker.2025 Renault Kiger: Engine performance and drive experienceAs mentioned earlier, we drove the Kiger in a controlled environment designed to test its abilities in areas like hill-hold, handling, agility, acceleration and stability. So, these are first impressions. A full verdict will have to wait until we drive it out on public roads and in traffic.That said, our test car was the 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine paired with a CVT. It produces 100 hp and 152 Nm of torque. There is also a manual version, and alongside the turbo, Renault continues to offer a NA petrol unit that makes 72 hp and 96 Nm.The turbo-petrol is easily the pick of the range if you enjoy driving. It feels lively in a straight line and holds its own at higher speeds. The CVT works well for daily use, though it isnât the most responsive when you ask for quick acceleration, and yes, you also do notice some turbo lag. Still, the engineâs peppy nature, combined with steering that feels direct and offers decent feedback, makes it engaging. There are three driving modes: Eco, Normal, and Sport; and you donât need to guess where it delivers the best. What also stands out is refinement. NVH levels are better controlled than before, and the turbo-petrol feels impressively smooth when cruising.At highway speeds, the Kiger feels planted and stable even in triple digits, which inspires confidence. Besides, the light steering makes it easy to manoeuvre, while it gains enough weight as speeds rise. That said, it may not be the sharpest handler in the segment, but it offers a good balance, making it enjoyable and easy to live with for everyday use.2025 Renault Kiger: VerdictThe Renault Kiger has always stood out for offering SUV appeal at hatchback money, and that continues to be its biggest strength. With prices starting at Rs 6.29 lakh, it undercuts several premium hatchbacks while giving buyers the higher ground clearance, sharper design, and SUV stance they desire. The 2025 update hasnât changed the formula drastically, but Renault has worked on the finer details: sharper styling, a more premium cabin feel, added features, and improved refinement. Overall, the Kiger is now a more complete package. For buyers looking at an affordable compact SUV that looks stylish, packs in good features, and drives well enough, the Renault Kiger can now be called a value-rich contender in a segment thatâs only getting tougher.Discover everything about the automotive world at Times of India."
