Foods that are lighter, plant-based, and non-violent in their preparation are chosen. Green vegetables, lentils, grains, fruits, and pulses become the staples. Paryushan is about asking for forgiveness for all the wrong doings you might have done knowingly or unknowingly. Mindful eating, plant-based diets, and sustainability have become popular buzzwords in modern wellness. These values have been a way of life in Jainism for centuries. Mindful eating is not just about what is on the plate, but about how we approach food. Eating without distractions, finishing what is served, expressing gratitude before meals, and reflecting on the journey of food from farm to plate are simple ways to bring the spirit of Paryushan into everyday life."

The dashboard layout is neat and Renault has tried to maximise space. The seats are well-cushioned, though a bit more under-thigh support at the rear would have been welcome on longer drives. The Renault Kiger has a 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine paired with a CVT. It produces 100 hp and 152 Nm of torque. There is also a manual version, and alongside the turbo, Renault continues to offer a NA petrol unit. The Renault Kiger has always stood out for offering SUV appeal at hatchback money. With prices starting at Rs 6.29 lakh, it undercuts several premium hatchbacks. Renault has worked on the finer details: sharper styling, a more premium cabin feel, added features, and improved refinement."
